      Rack mount LCD monitors can save you a lot of space and help you form a
      convenient and efficient desktop for your work or home study. The rack
      mount is set up so that the keyboard and LCD monitor are on a sliding
      rack that lest you move them out from your desk or over it. Once you
      decide to invest in the rack mount LCD monitor, you will have to install
      the rack and the monitor. Here, then, are steps in installing rack mount
      LCD monitors.<span class="span-1">The first step in installing rack mount LCD
        monitors is to get out and get one. They are available at most any home
        office or electronics store. Since the rack mounts are becoming more
        popular, they are easier to find now then aver before. Once you have
        your set, bring it home and spread all of the parts out along with the
        instructions so you can find what you need.</span>
      The first step will be to install the slides on your desk. Some rack
      mounting sets will include slides that are “handed.” That means that
      each slide is assigned a side of the monitor rack, but there are also
      sets where either slide can go on either side. Consult the instructions
      with your set to make sure you have mounted them correctly.
